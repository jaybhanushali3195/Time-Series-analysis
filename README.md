# Time-Series-analysis
Various Simulations and Time series analysis of various Data Sets

# For Recruitment data
The objective is to fit an auto-regressive process to the recruitment data, which is number of new fish for a period of 453 months, ranging over 1950s till 1987, and we'll be using Yule-Walker equations in matrix form to estimate the parameters of the fitted model.
# For Johnson & Johnson quarterly earnings per share
The objectives is, to fit an AR(p) model to Quarterly earnings in dollars per Johnson & Johnson share from 1960-1980.
#  Daily female births in California
fit an ARIMA model into a real life dataset 
<p>examine Ljung-Box Q-statistics for testing if there's an autocorrelation in a time series. </p>
<p>look if there's a trend in the data </p>
<p>look if there's a difference in the variation  </p>
<p>look at ACF, PACF. Akaike Information Criterion, sum of squared errors, and also Ljung-Box Q-statistics </p>

#  BJsales Data set.
  Performing Difference operations to bring in stationarity
  <p>Trying various models and selecting the best on the basis pf simplicity and AIC</p>
  
# Johnson & Johnson quarterly earnings(SARIMA)
<p>Fit sarima model to quaterly earnings of JOhnson and johnson share
<p> Residual analysis  
<p>Forecast future values of the examined time series.</p>

# Modelling process
<p> look at the time plot; if they need transformation, we're going to transform the data. 
<p> If we need differencing - seasonal or non-seasonal, we're going to do differencing.
<p> look at ACF and PACF to determine our orders.
<p> Once we have some idea of a lot about our orders PQ, we're going to look at a few different models
 <p>use the parsimony principle and choose the smallest AIC value.

# Milk Production Data set
Fit SARIMA model to Milk Production Data from TSDL(Time series data library)
<p> Residual analysis 
<p>Forecast future values of examined time series.</p>

# sales data at a souvenir shop in Australia
 fit SARIMA models to the dataset
 <p>forecast the future values of the same time series.</p>
 
 # Simple Exponential smoothing on London Rainfall Data set
   
 # Time-series analysis of Temperature and Electricity consumption

	<p>Analysed the temperature time series and Developed Holt-Winter Forecasting Method, ARIMA Seasonal Model in JMP.
  <p>Engineered a transfer function model for Temperature-Electricity consumption in JMP
  <p>Forecasted Electricity consumption for given next 6 months of temperatures.
  <p>Achieved forecasting accuracy of 97.9% using Seasonal ARIMA model in temperature forecasting.
